I dont play Fortnite as often anymore and dont need a bot.
This bot doesnt work. Just use [xMistt/fortnitepy-bot](https://github.com/xMistt/fortnitepy-bot)

# PartyBotNoAds

A Fortnite HTTP/XMPP bot coded in Python with party capabilities rewritten by kaaaxcreators without Ads.

---

## Installation

Install Python 3.7, you can get it from here: [Python 3.7.0 Download](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0-amd64.exe).

1. Install the required dependencies.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. [Register](https://epicgames.com/id/register) a new Epic Games account.

3. Configure your bot and enter the new Epic Games account details.

4. Launch the fortnite.py file and enjoy.

If you use Caprover or Docker there is a Dockerfile and captain-definition which fine.

Hosting with [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) works fine! You just have to use a cronjob or Uptimerobot and ping it every 15 minutes to keep it alive

## Ads

I removed all the Ads piped into BenBotAsync. You can edit the ad text in the `config.json`. There are only shell and website ads but no ads that users of the bot will see
With `\n` you make a new line, therefore you can create a multiline text
